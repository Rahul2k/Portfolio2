Hi there.... that's my portfolio..

I have to add my photo in it still......

I tried my best to make a good mobile responsive website but ultimately failed to do so

I still can't explain some of the behaviours of my website.... I mean I cross-checked it on the internet
(from w3schools.com , stackoverflow, quora and even youtube )

A simple position: fixed is not working properly.

But I am sure that I did everything I could do to make sure this doesn't happen.
